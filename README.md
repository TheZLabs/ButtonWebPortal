# ButtonWebPortal
Created because I needed something like this and couldn't find anything like it. Simple portal template with buttons redirecting to your link of choice. Change logo and colors to make it your own.

Runs on a basic apache2 server. Install apache2 on any linux server and place the index.html and images folder in /var/www/html then restart apache2. You should see you web portal. Edit index.html as desired to update logo.jpg or change button/text color.
